## 🚀 Ready for Next Steps

Your development environment is fully configured for:
- **Java 21 LTS** - Latest stable version for modern Spring Boot
- **Gradle 8.14.3** - Fast and flexible build system
- **Docker** - Containerization for microservices
- **Database clients** - Redis and PostgreSQL for testing connections
- **AWS tools** - CDK for Infrastructure as Code

## 📝 What's Next?

While you're setting up your AWS account, I can:

1. **Update architecture docs** for Gradle build system
2. **Create sample Gradle project structure** for microservices
3. **Prepare database migration scripts** for CockroachDB
4. **Create Docker Compose** file for local development

Or we can wait until your AWS account is ready and proceed with cloud infrastructure setup.

## 🏗️ Architecture Updates for Gradle

### Build System Changes
- **Maven** → **Gradle** for faster builds and better dependency management
- **Multi-project Gradle build** for all microservices
- **Gradle Kotlin DSL** for type-safe build scripts
- **Spring Boot Gradle Plugin** for easy packaging and running

### Gradle Benefits Over Maven
- **Faster builds** with incremental compilation
- **Better dependency management** with version catalogs
- **Flexible build scripts** with Kotlin DSL
- **Built-in caching** for improved performance
- **Easy multi-project** management

Ready to proceed with the next step!
