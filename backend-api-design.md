## Security Features

### Authentication
- JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry
- Refresh tokens with 7-day expiry
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- IP-based blocking for suspicious activity

### Data Protection
- All endpoints require authentication except auth routes
- Row-level security for multi-tenant data
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection headers

### Encryption
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- Column-level encryption for financial amounts
- Encrypted file storage for uploads

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for session storage
- Database query result caching
- CDN for file uploads
- ETag support for client-side caching

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing for frequent queries
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Database read replicas for analytics

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging
- Structured JSON logging
- Request/response logging
- Error tracking with stack traces
- Audit logs for sensitive operations

### Metrics
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Error rates by endpoint
- User activity metrics

### Health Checks
```
GET    /health                     # Basic health check
GET    /health/detailed            # Detailed system status
```
